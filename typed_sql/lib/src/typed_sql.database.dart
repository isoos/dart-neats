  // TODO: How do we deal with concurrent query/savePoint invocations?
  //       Clearly, if we have two concurrent calls to query() we'll just queue
  //       them. This works fine, and is expected. The user can do:
  //         await Future.wait(items.map((item) => ... tx ...));
  //       This is expected, even desired. We want these queries to be
  //       sequential, and this works fine!
  //       Sure it would have been faster with a [Database] instead, but it also
  //       possible that database isn't the only I/O happening in "... tx ...".
  //       In which case queued database lookups probably isn't bad, it's
  //       probably better than a runtime exception, though this can be debated!
  //
  //       But what if we have concurrent calls to savePoint(), again we could
  //       queue this, and doing so is probably not so bad.
  //       But if we do that and we accidentally have a call to [tx] inside the
  //       savePoint() then we have a deadlock! This is bad! Very bad!
  //       So might have to use zones to throw a StateError if trying to call
  //       tx from inside a savePoint. Or sp from inside a nested savePoint!
  //
  // TODO: Ensure we consistently throw StateError, if trying to do operations
  //       on a SavePoint or Transaction after it's been committed. This is a
  //       common error if you forget to await inside the method!
