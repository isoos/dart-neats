/// Documentation for `.where` on [Query], [SubQuery], [QuerySingle].
///
/// [target] must be either 'Query', 'SubQuery' or 'QuerySingle'.
String where(String target) => '''
    Filter [$target] using `WHERE` clause.

    Returns a [$target] retaining rows from this [$target] where the expression
    returned by [conditionBuilder] evaluates to `true`.
''';

/// Documentation for `.orderBy` on [Query] and [SubQuery].
///
/// [target] must be either 'Query' or 'SubQuery'.
String orderBy(String target) => '''
    Order [$target] using `ORDER BY` clause.

    Returns a [$target] with the same rows as this [$target], but ordered by
    the expressions returned by [builder].

    The [builder] callback must return a list of
    `(Expr<Comparable?>, Order)` records, where the [Order] specifies
    whether results should be sorted in [Order.ascending] or
    [Order.descending] order.

    Regardless of the [Order] given, `null` values are always sorted
    last. If you want `null` values sorted first, you can get this
    behavior using an extra `.isNull()` expression.

    For example:
    ```dart
    final result = await db.books
        .orderBy((book) => [
          // books where title == null will be sorted first now!
          (book.title.isNull(), Order.descending),
          (book.title, Order.ascending),
        ])

/// Documentation for `.limit` on [Query] and [SubQuery].

    Limit [$target] using `LIMIT` clause.

''';

/// Documentation for `.offset` on [Query] and [SubQuery].
///
/// [target] must be either 'Query' or 'SubQuery'.
String offset(String target) => '''
    Offset [$target] using `OFFSET` clause.

    The resulting [$target] will skip the first [offset] rows.
''';

/// Documentation for `.first` on [Query].
final firstQuery = '''
    Limit [Query] to the first row using `LIMIT` clause.

    This returns a [QuerySingle] which contains at-most one row.
''';

/// Documentation for `.count` on [Query].
final countQuery = '''
    Count number of rows in this [Query] using `COUNT(*)` aggregate
    function.

    The resulting [QuerySingle] will have exactly one row, which is the
    number of rows in the this query.

    This will count all rows, including rows with `null` values. If you
    don't wish to count `null` values, use [where] to filter out such
    rows first.
''';

/// Documentation for `.count` on [SubQuery].
final countSubQuery = '''
    Count number of rows in this [SubQuery] using `COUNT(*)` aggregate
    function.

    The resulting [Expr<int>] will evaluate to the number of rows in this
    [SubQuery].

    This will count all rows, including rows with `null` values. If you
    don't wish to count `null` values, use [where] to filter out such
    rows first.

String select(String target) => '''
    Create a projection of this [$target] using `SELECT` clause.

    The [projectionBuilder] **must** return a [Record] where all the
    values are [Expr] objects. If something else is returned you will
    get a [$target] object which doesn't have any methods!

    All methods and properties on [$target<T>] are extension methods and
    they are only defined for records `T` where all the values are
    [Expr] objects.

/// Documentation for `.join` on [Query].
final joinQuery = '''
    Join this [Query] with another [Query] using `JOIN` clause.

    This method returns a [Join] object on which you must call either
     * `.all` to get the cartesian product of the two queries, or,
     * `.on` to specify how the two queries should be joined.

    This always creates a `CROSS JOIN`, where the `.on` condition can be
    used to control how the two queries are joined.
''';

/// Documentation for `.exists` on [Query].
final existsQuery = '''
    Check for existance of rows in this [Query] using `EXISTS` operator.

    This returns a [QuerySingle] which contains exactly one row.
    The value of this query will be `true`, if this [Query] contains
    any rows, even if those rows are entirely `null`s.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you wish to use `.exists()` in a subquery considering
    > using `.asSubQuery.exists()` which returns an [Expr<bool>].

    Check for existance of rows in this [SubQuery] using `EXISTS` operator.

    This returns an [Expr<bool>] that evaluates to `true`, if this [SubQuery]
    contains any rows, even if those rows are entirely `null`s.

    Query the database for the row matching this [QuerySingle], if any.

/// present.
final fetchQuerySingleWithFetchOrNullsTip = '''
    Query the database for the row matching this [QuerySingle], if any.

    This returns at-most a single row because [QuerySingle] represents a [Query]
    containing at-most one row.

    > If you don't care about whether or not the row is `null` or not

    Query the database for the row matching this [QuerySingle], if any.

/// Documentation for `.union` on [Query] and [SubQuery].
///
/// [target] must be either 'Query' or 'SubQuery'.
String union(String target) => '''
    Combine this [$target] with [other] using `UNION` _set operator_.

    This returns a [$target] containing all the rows from this [$target]
    and [other] with duplicate rows appearing only once.
''';

/// Documentation for `.unionAll` on [Query] and [SubQuery].
///
/// [target] must be either 'Query' or 'SubQuery'.
String unionAll(String target) => '''
    Combine this [$target] with [other] using `UNION ALL` _set operator_.

    This returns a [$target] containing all the rows from this [$target] and
    [other]. Unlike `.union` this retains duplicate rows.

/// Documentation for `.intersection` on [Query] and [SubQuery].
///
/// [target] must be either 'Query' or 'SubQuery'.

  Combine this [$target] with [other] using `INTERSECT` _set operator_.

  [$target] and [other], with duplicate rows appearing only once.

/// Documentation for `.groupBy` on [Query].
final groupBy = '''
    Create projection for `GROUP BY` clause.

    The [groupBuilder] must return a [Record] where all the values are [Expr]
    objects. If something else is returned you will get a [Group] object which
    doesn't have any methods!

    This returns a [Group] object which has an `.aggregate` method that returns
    a query with a row for each distinct value of the projetion created by

    _aggregate functions_ over rows of this [Query] for each group.
